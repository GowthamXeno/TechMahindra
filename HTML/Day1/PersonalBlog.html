        <p>The concept of a "smart environment" has always intrigued me. Recently, I started working on a Smart
            Environment Management System that uses IoT devices to automate and improve our surroundings. One of the key
            components of this system is the DHT11 sensor, which measures temperature and humidity. This data helps the
            system make intelligent decisions, like controlling a fan to maintain comfort levels.
            But here’s the twist: what happens if you manually turn off the fan? I wanted my system to respect that
            decision, so I implemented logic to keep the fan off until the conditions significantly change. This ensures
            the system adapts to both automatic and manual inputs seamlessly.
            It’s exciting to see how technology can simplify life, and I can’t wait to share more about this project.
            Stay tuned for updates!</p>
